// find maximum forward difference between two numbers in a series of numbers. 
// The program should print out the max difference and the index location of 
// the two elements used

// Approach : If I understand the question correctly, a merge sort followed up 
// 			  by subtracting the last element with the first element should yield the 
// 		 	  desired max difference in O(log n)
